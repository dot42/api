{
		/// <summary>
		/// <para>This class represents the basic building block for user interface components. A View occupies a rectangular area on the screen and is responsible for drawing and event handling. View is the base class for <b>widgets</b>, which are used to create interactive UI components (buttons, text fields, etc.). The android.view.ViewGroup subclass is the base class for <b>layouts</b>, which are invisible containers that hold other Views (or other ViewGroups) and define their layout properties. </para><para> <h3>Developer Guides</h3></para><para> </para><para>For information about using this class to develop your application's user interface, read the  developer guide. </para><para> <h3>Using Views</h3></para><para>All of the views in a window are arranged in a single tree. You can add views either from code or by specifying a tree of views in one or more XML layout files. There are many specialized subclasses of views that act as controls or are capable of displaying text, images, or other content. </para><para>Once you have created a tree of views, there are typically a few types of common operations you may wish to perform: <ul><li><para><b>Set properties:</b> for example setting the text of a android.widget.TextView. The available properties and the methods that set them will vary among the different subclasses of views. Note that properties that are known at build time can be set in the XML layout files. </para></li><li><para><b>Set focus:</b> The framework will handled moving focus in response to user input. To force focus to a specific view, call requestFocus. </para></li><li><para><b>Set up listeners:</b> Views allow clients to set listeners that will be notified when something interesting happens to the view. For example, all views will let you set a listener to be notified when the view gains or loses focus. You can register such a listener using setOnFocusChangeListener(android.view.View.OnFocusChangeListener). Other view subclasses offer more specialized listeners. For example, a Button exposes a listener to notify clients when the button is clicked. </para></li><li><para><b>Set visibility:</b> You can hide or show views using setVisibility(int). </para></li></ul></para><para><b> Note: The Android framework is responsible for measuring, laying out and drawing views. You should not call methods that perform these actions on views yourself unless you are actually implementing a android.view.ViewGroup. </b></para><para> <h3>Implementing a Custom View</h3></para><para>To implement a custom view, you will usually begin by providing overrides for some of the standard methods that the framework calls on all views. You do not need to override all of these methods. In fact, you can start by just overriding onDraw(android.graphics.Canvas). <table></table></para><para>Category </para><para>Methods </para><para>Description &lt;/thead&gt;</para><para>&lt;tbody&gt; </para><para>Creation </para><para>Constructors </para><para>There is a form of the constructor that are called when the view is created from code and a form that is called when the view is inflated from a layout file. The second form should parse and apply any attributes defined in the layout file.   </para><para><code>onFinishInflate()</code> </para><para>Called after a view and all of its children has been inflated from XML. </para><para>Layout </para><para><code>onMeasure(int, int)</code> </para><para>Called to determine the size requirements for this view and all of its children.   </para><para><code>onLayout(boolean, int, int, int, int)</code> </para><para>Called when this view should assign a size and position to all of its children.   </para><para><code>onSizeChanged(int, int, int, int)</code> </para><para>Called when the size of this view has changed.  </para><para>Drawing </para><para><code>onDraw(android.graphics.Canvas)</code> </para><para>Called when the view should render its content.  </para><para>Event processing </para><para><code>onKeyDown(int, KeyEvent)</code> </para><para>Called when a new hardware key event occurs.   </para><para><code>onKeyUp(int, KeyEvent)</code> </para><para>Called when a hardware key up event occurs.   </para><para><code>onTrackballEvent(MotionEvent)</code> </para><para>Called when a trackball motion event occurs.   </para><para><code>onTouchEvent(MotionEvent)</code> </para><para>Called when a touch screen motion event occurs.  </para><para>Focus </para><para><code>onFocusChanged(boolean, int, android.graphics.Rect)</code> </para><para>Called when the view gains or loses focus.  </para><para><code>onWindowFocusChanged(boolean)</code> </para><para>Called when the window containing the view gains or loses focus.  </para><para>Attaching </para><para><code>onAttachedToWindow()</code> </para><para>Called when the view is attached to a window.  </para><para><code>onDetachedFromWindow</code> </para><para>Called when the view is detached from its window.  </para><para><code>onWindowVisibilityChanged(int)</code> </para><para>Called when the visibility of the window containing the view has changed.   &lt;/tbody&gt;</para><para> <h3>IDs</h3></para><para>Views may have an integer id associated with them. These ids are typically assigned in the layout XML files, and are used to find specific views within the view tree. A common pattern is to: <ul><li><para>Define a Button in the layout file and assign it a unique ID. <pre>
		///    &lt;Button
		///        android:id="@+id/my_button"
		///        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
		///        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
		///        android:text="@string/my_button_text"/&gt;
		///    </pre> </para></li><li><para>From the onCreate method of an Activity, find the Button <pre>
		///         Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);
		///    </pre> </para></li></ul></para><para>View IDs need not be unique throughout the tree, but it is good practice to ensure that they are at least unique within the part of the tree you are searching. </para><para> <h3>Position</h3></para><para>The geometry of a view is that of a rectangle. A view has a location, expressed as a pair of <b>left</b> and <b>top</b> coordinates, and two dimensions, expressed as a width and a height. The unit for location and dimensions is the pixel. </para><para>It is possible to retrieve the location of a view by invoking the methods getLeft() and getTop(). The former returns the left, or X, coordinate of the rectangle representing the view. The latter returns the top, or Y, coordinate of the rectangle representing the view. These methods both return the location of the view relative to its parent. For instance, when getLeft() returns 20, that means the view is located 20 pixels to the right of the left edge of its direct parent. </para><para>In addition, several convenience methods are offered to avoid unnecessary computations, namely getRight() and getBottom(). These methods return the coordinates of the right and bottom edges of the rectangle representing the view. For instance, calling getRight() is similar to the following computation: <code>getLeft() + getWidth()</code> (see  for more information about the width.) </para><para> <h3>Size, padding and margins</h3></para><para>The size of a view is expressed with a width and a height. A view actually possess two pairs of width and height values. </para><para>The first pair is known as <b>measured width</b> and <b>measured height</b>. These dimensions define how big a view wants to be within its parent (see  for more details.) The measured dimensions can be obtained by calling getMeasuredWidth() and getMeasuredHeight(). </para><para>The second pair is simply known as <b>width</b> and <b>height</b>, or sometimes <b>drawing width</b> and <b>drawing height</b>. These dimensions define the actual size of the view on screen, at drawing time and after layout. These values may, but do not have to, be different from the measured width and height. The width and height can be obtained by calling getWidth() and getHeight(). </para><para>To measure its dimensions, a view takes into account its padding. The padding is expressed in pixels for the left, top, right and bottom parts of the view. Padding can be used to offset the content of the view by a specific amount of pixels. For instance, a left padding of 2 will push the view's content by 2 pixels to the right of the left edge. Padding can be set using the setPadding(int, int, int, int) or setPaddingRelative(int, int, int, int) method and queried by calling getPaddingLeft(), getPaddingTop(), getPaddingRight(), getPaddingBottom(), getPaddingStart(), getPaddingEnd(). </para><para>Even though a view can define a padding, it does not provide any support for margins. However, view groups provide such a support. Refer to android.view.ViewGroup and android.view.ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams for further information. </para><para> <h3>Layout</h3></para><para>Layout is a two pass process: a measure pass and a layout pass. The measuring pass is implemented in measure(int, int) and is a top-down traversal of the view tree. Each view pushes dimension specifications down the tree during the recursion. At the end of the measure pass, every view has stored its measurements. The second pass happens in layout(int,int,int,int) and is also top-down. During this pass each parent is responsible for positioning all of its children using the sizes computed in the measure pass. </para><para>When a view's measure() method returns, its getMeasuredWidth() and getMeasuredHeight() values must be set, along with those for all of that view's descendants. A view's measured width and measured height values must respect the constraints imposed by the view's parents. This guarantees that at the end of the measure pass, all parents accept all of their children's measurements. A parent view may call measure() more than once on its children. For example, the parent may measure each child once with unspecified dimensions to find out how big they want to be, then call measure() on them again with actual numbers if the sum of all the children's unconstrained sizes is too big or too small. </para><para>The measure pass uses two classes to communicate dimensions. The MeasureSpec class is used by views to tell their parents how they want to be measured and positioned. The base LayoutParams class just describes how big the view wants to be for both width and height. For each dimension, it can specify one of: <ul><li><para>an exact number </para></li><li><para>MATCH_PARENT, which means the view wants to be as big as its parent (minus padding) </para></li><li><para>WRAP_CONTENT, which means that the view wants to be just big enough to enclose its content (plus padding). </para></li></ul>There are subclasses of LayoutParams for different subclasses of ViewGroup. For example, AbsoluteLayout has its own subclass of LayoutParams which adds an X and Y value. </para><para>MeasureSpecs are used to push requirements down the tree from parent to child. A MeasureSpec can be in one of three modes: <ul><li><para>UNSPECIFIED: This is used by a parent to determine the desired dimension of a child view. For example, a LinearLayout may call measure() on its child with the height set to UNSPECIFIED and a width of EXACTLY 240 to find out how tall the child view wants to be given a width of 240 pixels. </para></li><li><para>EXACTLY: This is used by the parent to impose an exact size on the child. The child must use this size, and guarantee that all of its descendants will fit within this size. </para></li><li><para>AT_MOST: This is used by the parent to impose a maximum size on the child. The child must gurantee that it and all of its descendants will fit within this size. </para></li></ul></para><para>To intiate a layout, call requestLayout. This method is typically called by a view on itself when it believes that is can no longer fit within its current bounds. </para><para> <h3>Drawing</h3></para><para>Drawing is handled by walking the tree and rendering each view that intersects the invalid region. Because the tree is traversed in-order, this means that parents will draw before (i.e., behind) their children, with siblings drawn in the order they appear in the tree. If you set a background drawable for a View, then the View will draw it for you before calling back to its <code>onDraw()</code> method. </para><para>Note that the framework will not draw views that are not in the invalid region. </para><para>To force a view to draw, call invalidate(). </para><para> <h3>Event Handling and Threading</h3></para><para>The basic cycle of a view is as follows: <ol><li><para>An event comes in and is dispatched to the appropriate view. The view handles the event and notifies any listeners. </para></li><li><para>If in the course of processing the event, the view's bounds may need to be changed, the view will call requestLayout(). </para></li><li><para>Similarly, if in the course of processing the event the view's appearance may need to be changed, the view will call invalidate(). </para></li><li><para>If either requestLayout() or invalidate() were called, the framework will take care of measuring, laying out, and drawing the tree as appropriate. </para></li></ol></para><para><b>Note: The entire view tree is single threaded. You must always be on the UI thread when calling any method on any view.</b> If you are doing work on other threads and want to update the state of a view from that thread, you should use a Handler. </para><para> <h3>Focus Handling</h3></para><para>The framework will handle routine focus movement in response to user input. This includes changing the focus as views are removed or hidden, or as new views become available. Views indicate their willingness to take focus through the isFocusable method. To change whether a view can take focus, call setFocusable(boolean). When in touch mode (see notes below) views indicate whether they still would like focus via isFocusableInTouchMode and can change this via setFocusableInTouchMode(boolean). </para><para>Focus movement is based on an algorithm which finds the nearest neighbor in a given direction. In rare cases, the default algorithm may not match the intended behavior of the developer. In these situations, you can provide explicit overrides by using these XML attributes in the layout file: <pre>
		///    nextFocusDown
		///    nextFocusLeft
		///    nextFocusRight
		///    nextFocusUp
		///    </pre> </para><para>To get a particular view to take focus, call requestFocus(). </para><para> <h3>Touch Mode</h3></para><para>When a user is navigating a user interface via directional keys such as a D-pad, it is necessary to give focus to actionable items such as buttons so the user can see what will take input. If the device has touch capabilities, however, and the user begins interacting with the interface by touching it, it is no longer necessary to always highlight, or give focus to, a particular view. This motivates a mode for interaction named 'touch mode'. </para><para>For a touch capable device, once the user touches the screen, the device will enter touch mode. From this point onward, only views for which isFocusableInTouchMode is true will be focusable, such as text editing widgets. Other views that are touchable, like buttons, will not take focus when touched; they will only fire the on click listeners. </para><para>Any time a user hits a directional key, such as a D-pad direction, the view device will exit touch mode, and find a view to take focus, so that the user may resume interacting with the user interface without touching the screen again. </para><para>The touch mode state is maintained across android.app.Activitys. Call isInTouchMode to see whether the device is currently in touch mode. </para><para> <h3>Scrolling</h3></para><para>The framework provides basic support for views that wish to internally scroll their content. This includes keeping track of the X and Y scroll offset as well as mechanisms for drawing scrollbars. See scrollBy(int, int), scrollTo(int, int), and awakenScrollBars() for more details. </para><para> <h3>Tags</h3></para><para>Unlike IDs, tags are not used to identify views. Tags are essentially an extra piece of information that can be associated with a view. They are most often used as a convenience to store data related to views in the views themselves rather than by putting them in a separate structure. </para><para> <h3>Properties</h3></para><para>The View class exposes an ALPHA property, as well as several transform-related properties, such as TRANSLATION_X and TRANSLATION_Y. These properties are available both in the Property form as well as in similarly-named setter/getter methods (such as setAlpha(float) for ALPHA). These properties can be used to set persistent state associated with these rendering-related properties on the view. The properties and methods can also be used in conjunction with Animator-based animations, described more in the  section. </para><para> <h3>Animation</h3></para><para>Starting with Android 3.0, the preferred way of animating views is to use the android.animation package APIs. These Animator-based classes change actual properties of the View object, such as alpha and translationX. This behavior is contrasted to that of the pre-3.0 Animation-based classes, which instead animate only how the view is drawn on the display. In particular, the ViewPropertyAnimator class makes animating these View properties particularly easy and efficient. </para><para>Alternatively, you can use the pre-3.0 animation classes to animate how Views are rendered. You can attach an Animation object to a view using setAnimation(Animation) or startAnimation(Animation). The animation can alter the scale, rotation, translation and alpha of a view over time. If the animation is attached to a view that has children, the animation will affect the entire subtree rooted by that node. When an animation is started, the framework will take care of redrawing the appropriate views until the animation completes. </para><para> <h3>Security</h3></para><para>Sometimes it is essential that an application be able to verify that an action is being performed with the full knowledge and consent of the user, such as granting a permission request, making a purchase or clicking on an advertisement. Unfortunately, a malicious application could try to spoof the user into performing these actions, unaware, by concealing the intended purpose of the view. As a remedy, the framework offers a touch filtering mechanism that can be used to improve the security of views that provide access to sensitive functionality. </para><para>To enable touch filtering, call setFilterTouchesWhenObscured(boolean) or set the android:filterTouchesWhenObscured layout attribute to true. When enabled, the framework will discard touches that are received whenever the view's window is obscured by another visible window. As a result, the view will not receive touches whenever a toast, dialog or other window appears above the view's window. </para><para>For more fine-grained control over security, consider overriding the onFilterTouchEventForSecurity(MotionEvent) method to implement your own security policy. See also MotionEvent#FLAG_WINDOW_IS_OBSCURED. </para><para>ref android.R.styleable::View_alpha  ref android.R.styleable::View_background  ref android.R.styleable::View_clickable  ref android.R.styleable::View_contentDescription  ref android.R.styleable::View_drawingCacheQuality  ref android.R.styleable::View_duplicateParentState  ref android.R.styleable::View_id  ref android.R.styleable::View_requiresFadingEdge  ref android.R.styleable::View_fadeScrollbars  ref android.R.styleable::View_fadingEdgeLength  ref android.R.styleable::View_filterTouchesWhenObscured  ref android.R.styleable::View_fitsSystemWindows  ref android.R.styleable::View_isScrollContainer  ref android.R.styleable::View_focusable  ref android.R.styleable::View_focusableInTouchMode  ref android.R.styleable::View_hapticFeedbackEnabled  ref android.R.styleable::View_keepScreenOn  ref android.R.styleable::View_layerType  ref android.R.styleable::View_layoutDirection  ref android.R.styleable::View_longClickable  ref android.R.styleable::View_minHeight  ref android.R.styleable::View_minWidth  ref android.R.styleable::View_nextFocusDown  ref android.R.styleable::View_nextFocusLeft  ref android.R.styleable::View_nextFocusRight  ref android.R.styleable::View_nextFocusUp  ref android.R.styleable::View_onClick  ref android.R.styleable::View_padding  ref android.R.styleable::View_paddingBottom  ref android.R.styleable::View_paddingLeft  ref android.R.styleable::View_paddingRight  ref android.R.styleable::View_paddingTop  ref android.R.styleable::View_paddingStart  ref android.R.styleable::View_paddingEnd  ref android.R.styleable::View_saveEnabled  ref android.R.styleable::View_rotation  ref android.R.styleable::View_rotationX  ref android.R.styleable::View_rotationY  ref android.R.styleable::View_scaleX  ref android.R.styleable::View_scaleY  ref android.R.styleable::View_scrollX  ref android.R.styleable::View_scrollY  ref android.R.styleable::View_scrollbarSize  ref android.R.styleable::View_scrollbarStyle  ref android.R.styleable::View_scrollbars  ref android.R.styleable::View_scrollbarDefaultDelayBeforeFade  ref android.R.styleable::View_scrollbarFadeDuration  ref android.R.styleable::View_scrollbarTrackHorizontal  ref android.R.styleable::View_scrollbarThumbHorizontal  ref android.R.styleable::View_scrollbarThumbVertical  ref android.R.styleable::View_scrollbarTrackVertical  ref android.R.styleable::View_scrollbarAlwaysDrawHorizontalTrack  ref android.R.styleable::View_scrollbarAlwaysDrawVerticalTrack  ref android.R.styleable::View_soundEffectsEnabled  ref android.R.styleable::View_tag  ref android.R.styleable::View_textAlignment  ref android.R.styleable::View_textDirection  ref android.R.styleable::View_transformPivotX  ref android.R.styleable::View_transformPivotY  ref android.R.styleable::View_translationX  ref android.R.styleable::View_translationY  ref android.R.styleable::View_visibility</para><para><para>android.view.ViewGroup </para></para>

		/// <para>Object used to report movement (mouse, pen, finger, trackball) events. Motion events may hold either absolute or relative movements and other data, depending on the type of device.</para><para><h3>Overview</h3></para><para>Motion events describe movements in terms of an action code and a set of axis values. The action code specifies the state change that occurred such as a pointer going down or up. The axis values describe the position and other movement properties. </para><para>For example, when the user first touches the screen, the system delivers a touch event to the appropriate View with the action code ACTION_DOWN and a set of axis values that include the X and Y coordinates of the touch and information about the pressure, size and orientation of the contact area. </para><para>Some devices can report multiple movement traces at the same time. Multi-touch screens emit one movement trace for each finger. The individual fingers or other objects that generate movement traces are referred to as <b>pointers</b>. Motion events contain information about all of the pointers that are currently active even if some of them have not moved since the last event was delivered. </para><para>The number of pointers only ever changes by one as individual pointers go up and down, except when the gesture is canceled. </para><para>Each pointer has a unique id that is assigned when it first goes down (indicated by ACTION_DOWN or ACTION_POINTER_DOWN). A pointer id remains valid until the pointer eventually goes up (indicated by ACTION_UP or ACTION_POINTER_UP) or when the gesture is canceled (indicated by ACTION_CANCEL). </para><para>The MotionEvent class provides many methods to query the position and other properties of pointers, such as getX(int), getY(int), getAxisValue, getPointerId(int), getToolType(int), and many others. Most of these methods accept the pointer index as a parameter rather than the pointer id. The pointer index of each pointer in the event ranges from 0 to one less than the value returned by getPointerCount(). </para><para>The order in which individual pointers appear within a motion event is undefined. Thus the pointer index of a pointer can change from one event to the next but the pointer id of a pointer is guaranteed to remain constant as long as the pointer remains active. Use the getPointerId(int) method to obtain the pointer id of a pointer to track it across all subsequent motion events in a gesture. Then for successive motion events, use the findPointerIndex(int) method to obtain the pointer index for a given pointer id in that motion event. </para><para>Mouse and stylus buttons can be retrieved using getButtonState(). It is a good idea to check the button state while handling ACTION_DOWN as part of a touch event. The application may choose to perform some different action if the touch event starts due to a secondary button click, such as presenting a context menu. </para><para><h3>Batching</h3></para><para>For efficiency, motion events with ACTION_MOVE may batch together multiple movement samples within a single object. The most current pointer coordinates are available using getX(int) and getY(int). Earlier coordinates within the batch are accessed using getHistoricalX(int, int) and getHistoricalY(int, int). The coordinates are "historical" only insofar as they are older than the current coordinates in the batch; however, they are still distinct from any other coordinates reported in prior motion events. To process all coordinates in the batch in time order, first consume the historical coordinates then consume the current coordinates. </para><para>Example: Consuming all samples for all pointers in a motion event in time order. </para><para><pre><code>
		///    void printSamples(MotionEvent ev) {
		///        final int historySize = ev.getHistorySize();
		///        final int pointerCount = ev.getPointerCount();
		///        for (int h = 0; h &lt; historySize; h++) {
		///            System.out.printf("At time %d:", ev.getHistoricalEventTime(h));
		///            for (int p = 0; p &lt; pointerCount; p++) {

		///        }
		///    }
		///    </code></pre></para><para><h3>Device Types</h3></para><para>The interpretation of the contents of a MotionEvent varies significantly depending on the source class of the device. </para><para>On pointing devices with source class InputDevice#SOURCE_CLASS_POINTER such as touch screens, the pointer coordinates specify absolute positions such as view X/Y coordinates. Each complete gesture is represented by a sequence of motion events with actions that describe pointer state transitions and movements. A gesture starts with a motion event with ACTION_DOWN that provides the location of the first pointer down. As each additional pointer that goes down or up, the framework will generate a motion event with ACTION_POINTER_DOWN or ACTION_POINTER_UP accordingly. Pointer movements are described by motion events with ACTION_MOVE. Finally, a gesture end either when the final pointer goes up as represented by a motion event with ACTION_UP or when gesture is canceled with ACTION_CANCEL. </para><para>Some pointing devices such as mice may support vertical and/or horizontal scrolling. A scroll event is reported as a generic motion event with ACTION_SCROLL that includes the relative scroll offset in the AXIS_VSCROLL and AXIS_HSCROLL axes. See getAxisValue(int) for information about retrieving these additional axes. </para><para>On trackball devices with source class InputDevice#SOURCE_CLASS_TRACKBALL, the pointer coordinates specify relative movements as X/Y deltas. A trackball gesture consists of a sequence of movements described by motion events with ACTION_MOVE interspersed with occasional ACTION_DOWN or ACTION_UP motion events when the trackball button is pressed or released. </para><para>On joystick devices with source class InputDevice#SOURCE_CLASS_JOYSTICK, the pointer coordinates specify the absolute position of the joystick axes. The joystick axis values are normalized to a range of -1.0 to 1.0 where 0.0 corresponds to the center position. More information about the set of available axes and the range of motion can be obtained using InputDevice#getMotionRange. Some common joystick axes are AXIS_X, AXIS_Y, AXIS_HAT_X, AXIS_HAT_Y, AXIS_Z and AXIS_RZ. </para><para>Refer to InputDevice for more information about how different kinds of input devices and sources represent pointer coordinates. </para><para><h3>Consistency Guarantees</h3></para><para>Motion events are always delivered to views as a consistent stream of events. What constitutes a consistent stream varies depending on the type of device. For touch events, consistency implies that pointers go down one at a time, move around as a group and then go up one at a time or are canceled. </para><para>While the framework tries to deliver consistent streams of motion events to views, it cannot guarantee it. Some events may be dropped or modified by containing views in the application before they are delivered thereby making the stream of events inconsistent. Views should always be prepared to handle ACTION_CANCEL and should tolerate anomalous situations such as receiving a new ACTION_DOWN without first having received an ACTION_UP for the prior gesture. </para>

The list returned by that function is used to populate the resulting menu items.</para><para>All of the menu items of possible options for the intent will be added with the given group and id. You can use the group to control ordering of the items in relation to other items in the menu. Normally this function will automatically remove any existing items in the menu in the same group and place a divider above and below the added items; this behavior can be modified with the <b>flags</b> parameter. For each of the generated items MenuItem#setIntent is called to associate the appropriate Intent with the item; this means the activity will automatically be started for you without having to do anything else.</para><para><para>FLAG_APPEND_TO_GROUP </para><simplesectsep></simplesectsep><para>MenuItem::setIntent </para><simplesectsep></simplesectsep><para>android.content.pm.PackageManager::queryIntentActivityOptions </para></para>

		/// <para>Object used to report key and button events. </para><para>Each key press is described by a sequence of key events. A key press starts with a key event with ACTION_DOWN. If the key is held sufficiently long that it repeats, then the initial down is followed additional key events with ACTION_DOWN and a non-zero value for getRepeatCount(). The last key event is a ACTION_UP for the key up. If the key press is canceled, the key up event will have the FLAG_CANCELED flag set. </para><para>Key events are generally accompanied by a key code (getKeyCode()), scan code (getScanCode()) and meta state (getMetaState()). Key code constants are defined in this class. Scan code constants are raw device-specific codes obtained from the OS and so are not generally meaningful to applications unless interpreted using the KeyCharacterMap. Meta states describe the pressed state of key modifiers such as META_SHIFT_ON or META_ALT_ON. </para><para>Key codes typically correspond one-to-one with individual keys on an input device. Many keys and key combinations serve quite different functions on different input devices so care must be taken when interpreting them. Always use the KeyCharacterMap associated with the input device when mapping keys to characters. Be aware that there may be multiple key input devices active at the same time and each will have its own key character map. </para><para>As soft input methods can use multiple and inventive ways of inputting text, there is no guarantee that any key press on a soft keyboard will generate a key event: this is left to the IME's discretion, and in fact sending such events is discouraged. You should never rely on receiving KeyEvents for any key on a soft input method. In particular, the default software keyboard will never send any key event to any application targetting Jelly Bean or later, and will only send events for some presses of the delete and return keys to applications targetting Ice Cream Sandwich or earlier. Be aware that other software input methods may never send key events regardless of the version. Consider using editor actions like android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo#IME_ACTION_DONE if you need specific interaction with the software keyboard, as it gives more visibility to the user as to how your application will react to key presses. </para><para>When interacting with an IME, the framework may deliver key events with the special action ACTION_MULTIPLE that either specifies that single repeated key code or a sequence of characters to insert. </para><para>In general, the framework cannot guarantee that the key events it delivers to a view always constitute complete key sequences since some events may be dropped or modified by containing views before they are delivered. The view implementation should be prepared to handle FLAG_CANCELED and should tolerate anomalous situations such as receiving a new ACTION_DOWN without first having received an ACTION_UP for the prior key press. </para><para>Refer to InputDevice for more information about how different kinds of input devices and sources represent keys and buttons. </para>
